# Purity Pursuit: The Three-Star Quest Campaign Manual

## Introduction
Welcome to the "Purity Pursuit: The Three-Star Quest" campaign! This initiative is designed to enhance the accuracy of our gold and silver coin testing application. As a senior staff member in the company, you'll play a crucial role in managing and executing various aspects of this campaign. This manual will guide you through each step of the process.

## Objective
The primary goal is to identify and confirm any false positives among 3-star results provided by our app. A 3-star result is assumed to be highly accurate, indicating a high purity level for tested coins. This campaign seeks to validate this accuracy or uncover any discrepancies.

## Campaign Overview
- **Name**: "Purity Pursuit: The Three-Star Quest"
- **Duration**: 6 months (or end earlier if a false positive is confirmed and rewarded)
- **Target Audience**: All subscribers of the application
- **Reward**: $30 (minus bank transfer fees) for the first user who successfully identifies a 3-star false positive. It is a one-time reward regardless of the number of false positives reported. An anonymous reward can be used upon the user's request.

## Participant's Process
1. **Identification of Suspicious 3-Star Result**: While testing their gold or silver coins using our app, users suspect a 3-star result is a false positive.
2. **Self-Verification**: Users double-check to ensure that the 3-star result is not due to misuse of the application or background noise.
3. **Reporting**: If all self-verification is done, and users still receive a suspicious 3-star result, they report it through the app using the "Report last test" feature.
4. **Remote Verification**: If required, the user must submit a video of the testing process, including weight and size measurements.
5. **Coin Mailing**: If required, users send the suspected coin to our office by tracked parcel/letter for further verification.
6. **Assay Analysis**: We request an assay office for detailed composition analysis (with potentiometric titration method).

### Self-Verification Steps:
1. The coin's weight and size are correct: the coin's weight is +/- 5% of its nominal weight, and the diameter is +/- 0.5 mm of its nominal size.
2. The coin is well pinged during the test.
3. The test is noise-free: if a user launches a test without pinging anything, the app should not give 3-star results.

## Important
- The detailed composition analysis by the assay office is a destructive process. Therefore, the mailed coin will become the asset of our company and will not be returned to the user.
- The postage fee is the responsibility of the participant. In case the user wins the reward, a $10 postage fee will be reimbursed to the winner regardless of the actual postage fees.
- For the sake of transparency of the campaign, we will publicly communicate one of the following pieces of information according to the winner's choice:
    - The first letter and last letter of the winner's email. (e.g., p\*\*\*r@g\*\*\*l.com for preciouscointester@gmail.com)
    - The winner's region (North America, South Europe, etc.)
    - The winner's initials (e.g., JS for James Smith).
- If the parcel is unable to arrive at our company (lost, border checks, etc.), the user does not win the campaign since we cannot verify if the coin is a real false positive. Please consider insurance to cover the potential loss.

## Your Responsibilities
- **Campaign Promotion**: Assist in creating and disseminating promotional materials for the campaign.
- **User Communication**: Respond to user inquiries about the campaign. Provide clear instructions for participation.
- **Initial Screening**: Perform a preliminary review of user submissions to filter out obvious non-qualifiers.
- **Verification Support**: Assist in verifying user submissions, including analyzing videos and coordinating with the assay office.
- **Data Recording**: Maintain accurate records of all submissions, communication, and verification results.
- **Reward Processing**: Assist in processing rewards for successful participants, ensuring compliance with the defined criteria.

## Verification Criteria
A 3-star false positive is confirmed if:
1. The app consistently gives 3-star results in a noise-free environment.
2. The coin's weight and size are within specified tolerances.
3. An in-app report with a timestamp is provided.
4. Video evidence supports the claim.
5. The assay office analysis confirms a discrepancy in metal content:
   - For silver coins: silver content is less than 10% of its nominal value.
   - For gold coins: gold content is less than 5% of its nominal value.

## Privacy and Data Protection
- The packaging or envelope will be destroyed after we retrieve the coin. The physical address on the parcel will not be retained.
- The participant's video is only kept locally in the company and won't be publicly available.
- The participant's full email address remains on email servers (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail) and won't be publicly communicated.
- The test ID of the report will be publicly communicated.

## Ethics and Transparency
All reported & processed tests should be recorded. A reason should be provided if the participant does not win the campaign. This information will be published publicly online with the following details: test ID, test time, report time, reason.

## Closing the Campaign
Assist in compiling a final report, summarizing the findings, successes, and areas for improvement. Participate in the post-campaign review to discuss lessons learned and potential application improvements.
